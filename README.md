Everything coded by "uberness02" was coded by "evandlr", I just forgot to switch to my new github account in terminal before pushing.
This is my first time using github, so I'm not sure if my code will actually work when accessed online, but it works in my IDE with solely these files so I think it should be fine?
Just download everything I guess, run the HTML, and enjoy!
