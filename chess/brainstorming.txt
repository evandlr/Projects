todo:
-fix pieces being able to move through pieces (just do a for loop for positions in way or smth)
-add turn system (just add a clause only letting white move if turn is odd and black if turn is even or smth)
-rework pawns (do this last fuck en passant and first move two square move and promotion)
-fix scaling with tab size
-fix background being messy
-make it not use stolen assets so i can actually release it
-add checkmate (super easy)
-add check (not so easy)
-add pins (hard)
-highlight squares that the held piece can move to (makes coding life easier too)
-add castling (also annoying like pawns)
-later project, add system to store moves and export as same move system as chess.com
-later later project, code some little shitty bots to figure out how tf that works
-menus, pretty text, make the head not the default on my ide
