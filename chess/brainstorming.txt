Ideas:
-class for black and white pieces
-class for movement type of piece
-id for each specific piece (so i can delete them)
-highlight pieces when clicked (to show being selected)
-when click on square without current color piece,
--check if piece can go there
--check if it would take a piece
--delete id of piece being taken
--move id of piece being moved to space
-keep track of turn with basic value
